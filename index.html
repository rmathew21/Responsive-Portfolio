        <p>Hi there! My name is Robin Mathew and I was born and raised in the great city of Houston! I’ve had the pleasure of living in Texas my entire life, while splitting time in San Antonio and Austin during the past 10 years. Home is definitely where my heart is and I’m glad to be back in Houston. I’m a huge Houston sports fan, and I love playing basketball as often as I can.</p>

        <p>I’ve been working with Apple’s Developer Program Support team for the past 8 years. It’s been a great ride, and I get to  speak with developers regarding their apps on a daily basis.  I’m looking for growth in my career and feel very fortunate to attend UT’s Coding Bootcamp here in Houston. I’m excited to learn coding and look forward to this great opportunity I have in front of me.</p>
